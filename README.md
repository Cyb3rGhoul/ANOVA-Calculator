# ANOVA Calculator

![ANOVA Calculator](anova-calculator.png)

The ANOVA Calculator is a web-based application that performs analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculations for both one-way and two-way ANOVA tests. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering data and displays the results, including the sum of squares, degrees of freedom, mean squares, F-ratios, and critical F-values.

## Features

- **One-Way ANOVA**: Calculate the ANOVA for a single factor with multiple levels or groups.
- **Two-Way ANOVA**: Perform ANOVA calculations for experiments involving two factors (treatment and block/subject).
- Dynamic input fields for entering data based on the number of groups or blocks and treatments.
- Calculation of correction factor, sum of squares (total, treatment, block, and error), degrees of freedom, mean squares, and F-ratios.
- Display of critical F-value (user-provided or calculated based on the level of significance).

## Usage

1. Open the ANOVA Calculator website in your web browser.
2. For One-Way ANOVA:
   - Enter the number of groups.
   - Input the data for each group, separating values with commas.
   - (Optional) Enter the critical F-value or the level of significance (alpha) to calculate the critical F-value.
   - Click the "Calculate ANOVA" button to perform the calculations.
3. For Two-Way ANOVA:
   - Enter the number of blocks and treatments.
   - Input the data for each block and treatment combination in the provided input fields.
   - Enter the critical F-value.
   - Click the "Calculate ANOVA" button to perform the calculations.
4. The results will be displayed on the webpage, including the sum of squares, degrees of freedom, mean squares, F-ratios, and critical F-value.
